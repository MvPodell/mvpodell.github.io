            <h1>CSS Selectors Cheatsheet!</h1>
                <h3>CSS selectors help HTML developers to specify styles for individual elements of their code. 
                    They can select HTML elements by type, class, ID, and attribute. </h3>
        </div>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Selector Name</th>
                    <th>Selector Format</th>
                    <th>Level of Specificity</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Universal</td>
                    <td class="code">* {...}</td>
                    <td>Least</td>
                    <td>All HTML elements are selected using the universal selector. When CSS rules are written in 
                        this format, every HTML on the page will be assigned those styling rules. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Type</td>
                    <td class ="code"> &lttype&gt{...}</td>
                    <td>Low</td>
                    <td>Selects HTML elements of a certain type and applies the same CSS rules to 
                        all of them. If a more specific selector addresses a certain element that would normally 
                        fall under this type's jurisdiction, HTML uses the rules laid down by the more specific
                        CSS selector, therefore always overriding this selector since it is the weakest. </td>
                </tr>
                <!-- Class section -->
                <tr>
                    <td>Class</td>
                    <td class="code">.className {...}</td>
                    <td>Medium</td>
                    <td>Classes are reusable labels for HTML elements. CSS styling rules 
                        inside a class are only applied to HTML elements with the specified class
                         passed in as a <strong>class</strong> property. A class property can take 
                         in more than one class, separated by a space, to assign the CSS rules of more 
                         than 1 class to an HTML element.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ID</td>
                    <td class="code">#idName {...}</td>
                    <td>Highest</td>
                    <td>Selects the HTML element with the specificed <strong>id</strong> property passed in passed in.
                         This can only be used once in an HTML file, and is the most specific selector. </td>
                </tr>

        <h3>Beyond these 4 selector types, there are a few other tricks that are useful when writing selectors.</h3>

            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Format</th>

                <tr>
                    <td class="code">selector, selector {...}</td>
                    <td>Note the comma in this selector format. You can use this format to style multiple elements 
                        of different specifities (id, class, or type). This saves the coder the hassle of having to 
                        write out the same style rules for different selectors.</td>
                <tr>
                    <td class="code">type.class {...}</td>
                    <td>Use this format in order to style elements of a certain type that also have a specific class. </td>
